# 📊 Python Data Processing & Analysis  

### 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **data preprocessing and analysis** using **Python, Pandas, and NumPy**. The dataset consists of three different tables that are cleaned, transformed, and merged to generate meaningful insights.  

---

### 🚀 Tasks Completed  

#### **✅ Task 1: Load & Save Data**  
✔️ Created three separate **dataframes** from given tables.  
✔️ Saved them as **CSV files** for further processing.  

#### **✅ Task 2: Handle Missing Values**  
✔️ Imputed missing values in the **cost** column of the Project dataframe.  
✔️ Used **running average** with a **for loop** to fill missing values.  

#### **✅ Task 3: Split Name Column**  
✔️ Split the **name** column in the Employee dataframe into **First Name** and **Last Name**.  
✔️ Dropped the original **name** column.  

#### **✅ Task 4: Merge DataFrames**  
✔️ Joined all three dataframes into a **single dataframe** named **Final**.  

#### **✅ Task 5: Calculate Bonus**  
✔️ Added a new **bonus column (5% of project cost)** for employees who **completed** their projects.  

#### **✅ Task 6: Designation Adjustments**  
✔️ **Demoted** designation level by **1** for employees whose projects **failed**.  
✔️ **Removed** records of employees whose **designation level was above 4**.  

#### **✅ Task 7: Modify First Name**  
✔️ Added **"Mr."** or **"Mrs."** to the **First Name** column based on gender.  
✔️ Dropped the **gender** column after modifications.  

#### **✅ Task 8: Promotion Based on Age**  
✔️ **Promoted designation level by 1** for employees **older than 29 years** using an **IF condition**.  

#### **✅ Task 9: Calculate Total Project Cost per Employee**  
✔️ Created a **new dataframe (TotalProjCost)** with three columns:  
   - **ID**  
   - **First Name**  
   - **Total Cost of all Projects** assigned to them  

#### **✅ Task 10: Filter Employees by City**  
✔️ Extracted employee details where the **city name contains the letter "o"**.
